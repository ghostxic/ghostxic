# Hi there, I'm Michael 👋

### CS & Statistics @ University of Illinois | Class of 2028

I'm passionate about building tools that make a real difference in people's daily lives. Whether it's simplifying how students find food or helping people schedule their day more naturally, I focus on creating solutions that improve quality of life.

**Eats@UIUC**  
A Yelp-style app designed specifically for UIUC students to discover great food around campus. Built through club collaboration.

**Frameworks & Tools:** Flask • pandas • scikit-learn • TensorFlow

## ⭐ Featured Project

### Natural Language Calendar App
Developed a full-stack web application that lets users schedule Google Calendar events using plain English. No more clicking through date pickers. Just type "coffee with Sarah next Tuesday at 3pm" and you're done.

*Built with NLP processing and Google Calendar API integration*

## 🏋️ Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, you'll find me at the gym. Working out is a relatively new hobby for me, but staying consistent with it has been a game-changer for my life, both mentally and physically!
